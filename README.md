### Checkers
A game of checkers with javascript.

### How to play
Each player begins the game with 12 pieces, or checkers, placed in the three rows closest to him or her. The player with the red checkers goes first. The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's checkers or position your pieces so that your opponent has no available moves. Basic movement is to move a checker one space diagonally forward. If one of your checkers reaches the other side of the board, it becomes a king, and can then move backwards and forwards. If you find your checker next to one of your opponent's checkers (in the direction you are allowed to move), and there is a space on the other side, you can jump their checker and capture it. The player who captures all of the other player's checkers wins.
### Technologies Used

* FontAwesome
* Bootstrap
* Trello

### Future Development
* #### Detect when a jump is possible.
This will allow me to enforce jumping when it is possible. I will also be able to detect opportunities to double jump(or more than double) opponents.
* #### UI Additions
I plan to implement some features on the UI as well, including highlighting the scoreboard to indicate which player's turn it is, and indicating visually which tiles are valid places to place a checker once it has been selected.
